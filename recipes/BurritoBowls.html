    <h4>How to make Tofu Burrito Bowl</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons
        oil. Break tofu apart over skillet into bite-size pieces, sprinkle with
        salt and pepper, then cook, stirring frequently with a thin metal
        spatula, until liquid cooks out and tofu browns, about 10 minutes. (If
        you notice liquid collecting in pan, increase heat to evaporate water.)
        Be sure to get under the tofu when you stir, scraping the bottom of the
        pan where the good, crispy stuff is and keeping it from sticking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add onion and garlic powders, turmeric, juice, and remaining tablespoon
        oil and toss to coat. Cook 5 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. Add oil. Cook
        onion and jalapenos with a pinch of salt, stirring, until translucent,
        about 5 minutes, Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30
        seconds. Add tomatoes, cumin, and remaining salt, and cook, stirring,
        until tomatoes become saucy, about 5 minutes. Add cilantro and lemon
        juice. Let cilantro wilt in. Add beans and heat through, stirring
        occasionally, about 2 minutes. Taste for salt and seasoning.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon some hash browns into each bowl, followed by a scoop of beans and
        a scoop of scramble. Top with avocado, a squeeze of fresh lemon juice,
        and a sprinkle of cilantro. Serve with hot sauce.
