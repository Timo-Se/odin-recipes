    <h2>What makes the Denver Omelet so special?</h2>
    <p>
      The beauty of the Denver omelet lies in its simplicity and the balance of
      flavors and textures. The combination of diced smoked ham, green bell
      peppers, onions, and Cheddar cheese creates a harmonious medley of savory,
      sweet, and slightly tangy tastes. Each bite offers something special, from
      the smoky richness of the ham to the crunch of freshly saut√©ed vegetables
      and the creamy indulgence of melted cheese

      <h4>How to Make The Denver Omelet</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Beat eggs in a small bowl until just combined; do not overbeat.</li>
        <li>
          Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add ham, onion, and
          bell pepper; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until onions
          soften and ham begins to caramelize, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduce heat to medium-low and pour in eggs. Mix briefly with a spatula
          while shaking the pan to ensure ingredients are evenly distributed.
        </li>
        <li>Quickly run the spatula along edges of omelet.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle Cheddar cheese and cayenne pepper over omelet.</li>
        <li>
          Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until top is still wet but not
          runny, about 5 minutes. Use a spatula to fold omelet in half and
          transfer it to a plate.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </ul>
